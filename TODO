link this repo in place of current config, compare with latest kickstart
use sessions if they work as intended (open dirs/workspaces with cached files)
set number column width to 3
structure into files, look up how pros do it (0 to LSP Linux bookmark, GPT)
maybe remove auto whitespace trimming - or just don't trim on write - 3 plugins
	won't auto format on save and other plugins have the same problem?
	maybe the problem is saving on undo/redo, but how can you fix it?
shortcut for sorting paragraph (vip-sort)

auto :!clang-format -i <path>
undefined global `vim` after edit/write

auto format and wrap line at limit on save (variable = '89' or whatever used across)
whitespace trimming breaks undo
multiple terminals - is tmux necessary? separate "tab"(? i.e. window) would be nice
cleanup all the install paths + config/local/cache
shortcuts for putting text from clipboard on a new line even though it doesn't have one
	or to separate on a new line, like the inverse of j/J and take care of spaces in any context
update to latest version that works (at least 0.9.4)
opening dir looks broken
